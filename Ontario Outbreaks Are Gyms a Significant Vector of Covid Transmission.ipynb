So that would make 735,000 gym-goers in Ontario in 2020. Other statistics suggest the average times gone per week is between 1 and 4 - likely people that go to the gym (the 30% of those with memberships) actually are going on a regular basis. \n",

    "It would appear that when controlling for the increased vaccination rate at the time when vax passes were introduced and accounting for the fact that more people had natural immunity in by September 2021 compared to September 2020, we do not see any statistically significant effect of the introduction of vax passes.\n",
